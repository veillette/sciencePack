# Post-Processing Your Form 2 Print

## Introduction to post-processing

Your print has just been completed, and you're looking at a beautiful piece attached to the build platform – but we're not quite finished yet. Post-processing is crucial for Form 2 prints, transforming them from sticky, uncured models into strong, safe-to-handle final pieces. This guide will walk you through each step of the process, explaining not just what to do, but why each step matters.

## Safety First

Before we begin, remember that uncured resin is still present on your print. This means you'll need to wear nitrile gloves throughout the entire post-processing procedure. Safety glasses are also required during the cleaning process, as isopropyl alcohol can splash. If you wear contact lenses, you might want to wear goggles instead of glasses for extra protection.

## Initial Removal

When you first remove your print from the build platform, you'll notice it's still covered in liquid resin. Place the build platform over the washing station sink, and using the provided scraper tool, carefully wedge under one corner of your print. Work slowly around the edges until the print is released. The goal isn't to force the piece off, but rather to gradually break the seal between the print and platform. If you're having trouble, try working from a different angle – sometimes prints adhere more strongly in certain areas.

## The Washing Process

Your print now needs two separate baths in isopropyl alcohol. Think of this like washing dishes – the first wash removes most of the residue, while the second ensures everything is truly clean. Each wash station is clearly marked as "First Wash" and "Final Wash."

For the first wash, submerge your print in the "First Wash" container for about 5 minutes. During this time, gently agitate the basket holding your print. This movement helps the alcohol reach all surfaces, even deep crevices and internal features. You'll notice the alcohol becoming cloudy around your print – this is normal and means the uncured resin is being removed.

After the first wash, let your print drip dry for about 30 seconds, then transfer it to the "Final Wash" container. This second bath should last another 5 minutes. The cleaner alcohol in this bath removes any remaining residue that the first wash missed. Your print should feel clean and non-sticky when you remove it, though it will still be wet with alcohol.

## Drying Your Print

After washing, let your print air dry completely. A paper towel can be used to pat the print, but avoid rubbing, as this might leave marks on the surface.

## UV Curing

Even though your print feels solid, it still needs to be fully cured to reach its maximum strength and stability. Place your dried print in the UV curing station. Orient your print so that all surfaces will receive UV exposure – this might mean curing it in multiple orientations for complex geometries. The standard curing time is 15 minutes for clear resins and 30 minutes for colored resins.

If your print has thick sections, you might want to flip it halfway through the curing process to ensure even curing throughout.

## Support Removal

Now that your print is fully cured, it's time to remove any supports. While it might be tempting to simply break them off, taking a more methodical approach will give you better results. Use the flush cutters provided at the workstation, cutting each support at two points: one near the base and one close to where it meets your print. This two-cut approach prevents you from accidentally damaging your print's surface.

For particularly delicate pieces, you might want to cut the supports in small sections, working your way around the print gradually. Pay special attention to areas where supports meet thin features or detailed areas of your print.

## Final Finishing

After support removal, you might notice small nubs where the supports were attached. These can be carefully sanded away using fine-grit sandpaper (start with 220 grit and work up to 400 or higher for a smooth finish). Remember to sand in one direction rather than circular motions for the best results. If your print requires a perfectly smooth surface, you can continue with progressively finer grits of sandpaper, all the way up to 2000 grit for a near-polished finish.

## Quality Check

Before considering your print complete, examine it under good lighting. Look for any uncured resin residue (it will feel tacky), support marks that need additional sanding, or any other imperfections that need attention. A properly post-processed print should be completely dry, smooth to the touch, and free from any sticky residue.

## Cleanup

Don't forget to clean your workspace thoroughly when you're done. Dispose of used paper towels in the resin waste container, not the regular trash. Wipe down any tools you used with isopropyl alcohol, and ensure all containers are properly sealed. Remove your gloves last and dispose of them in the resin waste container as well.

Remember, a well-executed post-processing procedure is just as important as the printing itself. Each step builds on the previous one to ensure your final piece is strong, clean, and ready for use. Take your time with each stage – rushing through post-processing can undo hours of careful printing.
