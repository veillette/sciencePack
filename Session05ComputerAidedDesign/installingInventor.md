# Introduction to CAD Workshop

Welcome to our introductory CAD workshop! In this hands-on session, you'll learn the fundamentals of Computer-Aided Design using Autodesk Inventor. 

**Software**: Autodesk Inventor

## Getting Started with Autodesk Inventor

Before the workshop, please follow these steps to set up Autodesk Inventor on your computer:

First, visit the Autodesk Education Community website (www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software). You'll need to create an account using your student email address. Once your student status is verified, you'll have access to a free educational license for Autodesk Inventor.

Download the installer appropriate for your operating system (Windows only). The installation process typically takes 15-30 minutes, depending on your internet connection. Make sure you have at least 20GB of free disk space available.

After installation, launch Inventor and sign in with your Autodesk account to activate your educational license.

## Understanding CAD Basics

Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a technology that allows us to create precise digital models of physical objects. In Inventor, we work in a 3D environment, but we begin our designs in 2D sketches that we later transform into 3D forms.

The design process typically follows these stages: creating a 2D sketch, adding dimensions and constraints, and then using features like extrusion to create 3D geometry. Think of it as digital sculpting, where we start with a flat drawing and give it height, depth, and form.
