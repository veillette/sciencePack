# Introduction to Astronomy Workshop
## Setup Guide for NexStar 8SE Telescope

Welcome to your first astronomy workshop! Tonight, you'll learn how to set up and use a computerized telescope to explore the night sky. This guide will walk you through each step of the process.

### What You'll See in Spring (7-9 PM)
- The Moon will be visible in the southern sky (ideal for our deck's location)
- Jupiter and Venus may be visible (depending on the specific date)
- Several bright winter constellations like Orion and Taurus

### Safety First
- Never point the telescope at the Sun (even when setting up during daylight)
- Be careful with the equipment - the telescope is delicate and expensive
- Watch your step in the dark - use red flashlights to preserve night vision

### Telescope Setup Guide

#### Step 1: Mounting the Telescope
1. Remove the telescope from its case carefully (ask for help if needed)
2. Locate the dovetail mounting bracket on the telescope
3. Loosen the mounting knob on the base head
4. Carefully slide the telescope into the mount
5. Tighten the mounting knob securely

#### Step 2: Powering Up
1. Insert 8 AA batteries or connect the AC adapter
2. Ensure the power switch is in the OFF position
3. Connect the hand controller
4. Turn the power switch ON
5. Wait for the startup sequence to complete

#### Step 3: Alignment Process
1. The telescope will ask for your location:
   - Latitude: 37°34'N (Berea, KY)
   - Longitude: 84°17'W
2. Enter the current time and date
3. Choose "Two Star Align" when prompted
4. The telescope will suggest bright stars
   (you can use a smarthphone to find the identity of stars)
5. Use the arrow buttons to center each star in the eyepiece
6. Press ALIGN after centering each star

### Using the Telescope

#### Basic Controls
- DIRECTION buttons (↑↓←→): Move the telescope
- RATE button: Changes how fast the telescope moves
- ENTER: Confirms selections
- BACK: Returns to previous menu

#### Finding Objects
1. Press OBJECT to access the database
2. Choose a category (Solar System, Stars, etc.)
3. Select your target
4. Press ENTER to have the telescope slew to the object
5. Look through the eyepiece and use the arrow keys for fine adjustment

### Observing Tips
- Start with the lowest power eyepiece (25mm)
- Center objects before switching to higher power
- Allow your eyes 20-30 minutes to adapt to darkness
- Use the red flashlight provided to read star charts
- Don't touch the glass surfaces of the telescope
- Be patient - astronomy takes practice!

### Tonight's Targets
1. The Moon
   - Look for craters along the terminator (day/night line)
   - Try to identify major features like Mare Imbrium
2. Bright Stars
   - Start with Sirius, the brightest star
   - Practice star-hopping between bright stars
3. Star Clusters
   - The Pleiades (M45) - visible to naked eye
   - Look for the Beehive Cluster if visible

### Common Issues and Solutions
- Telescope won't power on:
  - Check battery connections
  - Try fresh batteries
- Stars appear unfocused:
  - Use the focus knob slowly
  - Start with bright objects
- Can't find objects:
  - Verify alignment was successful
  - Make sure date/time/location are correct

### End of Session
1. Power down the telescope
2. Remove batteries if using them
3. Replace all dust caps
4. Never force any movements
5. Help pack equipment carefully
