# Evening Sky Workshop: Using the NexStar 8SE Telescope
*A Beginner's Guide to Observing from Berea College*

Welcome to tonight's astronomy workshop! Over the next two hours, we'll learn how to set up and use the NexStar 8SE telescope to observe celestial objects. Don't worry if you've never used a telescope before - we'll go through everything step by step.

## Before We Begin

Tonight's workshop runs from 7 PM to 9 PM, which gives us perfect timing for viewing some magnificent objects. From our location on the deck of the MAC building, we should be able to see Jupiter and the Moon, among other celestial objects. 

## Setting Up the Telescope

The NexStar 8SE might look complicated, but we'll break down the setup into manageable steps. Your instructor will be present to help, but this guide will walk you through each part of the process.

### First Steps: The Physical Setup

Start by setting up the tripod on level ground. The telescope is fairly heavy, so don't hesitate to ask for help. Once the tripod is stable, you'll notice a mounting plate on top. This is where the telescope's base will attach.

The telescope's fork arm mount should be placed on this plate - it will only fit one way, so don't worry about getting it wrong. You'll hear a satisfying click when it's properly seated. Your instructor will help secure the mounting bolts.

### Powering Up

The NexStar 8SE needs power to operate. There should already be batteries, but if your telescope does not ppower up, but you may need fresh AA batteries (You will need 8 of them).  You can insert them into the battery compartment at the base of the fork arm. Once the batteries are in, you'll find the power switch on the fork arm's base. Don't turn it on just yet!

### The Critical Alignment Process

This is the most important part of our evening - proper alignment will make the difference between finding celestial objects easily and spending the night frustrated. Here's what we'll do:

1. When you turn on the power, the hand control will light up and ask for your location. We're in Berea, Kentucky, so enter:
   - Latitude: 37°34'N
   - Longitude: 84°17'W

2. Next, it will ask for the time and date. Accuracy matters here - the telescope uses this information to calculate where objects should be in the sky.

3. Now comes the interesting part - the "SkyAlign" process. We'll need to point the telescope at three bright objects in the sky. For reference, our deck is facing South. Don't worry about knowing star names - the telescope will figure out what you're pointing at!

## Making Your First Observation

Let's start with something easy to find - the Moon is an excellent first target. Using the hand control, press the "Solar System" button and select "Moon" from the menu. The telescope will slew (move) to point at the Moon.

Look through the eyepiece. If you can't see anything clearly, don't panic! Use the focus knob on the back of the telescope to adjust until the image becomes sharp. Take your time - focusing is an art that takes a little practice.

### Observing Tips
- Start with the lowest power eyepiece (25mm)
- Center objects before switching to higher power
- Allow your eyes 20-30 minutes to adapt to darkness
- Don't touch the glass surfaces of the telescope
 
## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you're having trouble seeing anything, check these common issues:
- Is the image blurry? Try adjusting the focus very slowly
- Can't see anything at all? Make sure you're looking through the eyepiece at the correct angle
- Object not in the field of view? Verify that the alignment was successful

## What's Next?

Once you're comfortable with the Moon, we'll move on to viewing a planet. Ok that depends on the day of the viewing, but hopefully Jupiter, Saturn or Mars is in the sky. This will give you practice using the telescope's computerized features and help you understand how to find dimmer objects in the night sky.

Remember, astronomy takes patience. Don't get discouraged if things aren't perfect on your first try - that's why we're here to learn together!

## End of Session Care

Before we wrap up for the evening, we'll properly shut down and store the telescope. This ensures it's ready for the next group of aspiring astronomers.
